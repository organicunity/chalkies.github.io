# What's a chalky?

Chalkies are anyone on [SF Chalkboard](https://lists.riseup.net/www/info/sfchalkboard), a mailing list for community and cooperative living in the San Francisco bay area.

It's meant to strengthen ties between cooperative houses, collectives, activists and other intentional communities. To know what's going on in our wider world. It's the chalkboard in our collective kitchen.

As of July 2023, there are 3717 subscribers

# How do I join?

Go to [our info page](https://lists.riseup.net/www/info/sfchalkboard), click subscribe

[This page](https://lists.riseup.net/www/help/introduction) explains how mailing lists work

Once you join, you can read and search the [archives](https://lists.riseup.net/www/arc/sfchalkboard)

# Who can join?

The list is for anybody interested in living in an inclusive and supportive community that values cooperation, mutual aid, fun, and meaningful change. Anyone can join and post, whether they live in a co-op or not.

# How to post?

Email your post to [sfchalkboard@lists.riseup.net](mailto:sfchalkboard@lists.riseup.net)
* **Double check** the address! A common mistake is to send to "sfchalkboard-request", which won't go to the list.
* Write a **descriptive subject** - let us know what your post will be about. For example, "Looking for a room in Oakland with queer friendly vegan punks"
* Write a **full email body** including all relevant content. Posts without much more than a link will be rejected!
* **Address the Chalkies group** in your message body - this discourages cross-posting and keeps content unique and personalized
* **No large attachments**
* Think carefully before you send your email - once moderators approve it, [we cannot delete it!](#can-i-delete-a-post)
* We have special rules for posts about [housing](#rooms), [events](#events) or anything involving [money](#money)

Your post can include things like:
* [Room openings](#rooms)
* [Community events](#events)
* Rallies, protests
* Parties, potlucks
* Discussion groups
* Resources, skillshares

Your post must not include anything:
* racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, ageist, ableist, etc
* promoting destructive technologies like bitcoin
* far away from the bay area, without some local aspect or relationship
* inaccessible to blind users - please transcribe or caption all images

# How to reply?

When replying to posts:
* If you want to reply to the author of a message, please remove the list address first.
* If the reply content is relevant to the entire list, please address the person + the entire list which supports coziness and keeps it from appearing like a conversation between two people. For example:
    > Becca & Chalkies. Becca, I wanted to respond to your post and yes all collectives, co-ops and community minded individuals are welcome to attend the gathering,...here’s the rest of the details...
    {:.do}
* Don't use digest mode. But if you do, see [here...](#digest)

# Digest

We strongly recommend to not use digest mode. It sucks. Instead, we recommend you subscribe to individual emails, and use filters in your email client to manage them. If you absolutely must use digest mode, please note:
* When you reply to a message digest, please try to edit the quote text and subject.
* Riseup has a bug which fails to display the author's email address in some cases - digest users will not be able to see it, and the web archives will not show it either. We have reported this bug to riseup, but they will probably take a very long time to fix it. Sorry! If you're a digest user and you want to send a private reply, send it to [sfchalkboard-editors](mailto:sfchalkboard-editors@lists.riseup.net) and the moderators will put you in touch.

# Can I hide my name?

Whatever name your email software uses, it will be at the top of the post. If you don't want to show your name, you should configure your email software to not show it.

You cannot hide your email address. If you want to be fully anonymous, you will need to create a separate email address and use that.

Alternatively, you can [contact a mod](#who-runs-it) and one of us can send it for you. Or you can just say at the top of your email that you want it to be anonymous. Then a mod can copy the text of your message and then reject the original.

# Can I delete a post?

No, sorry. We can delete it from the archives, but once everybody has received the email, we cannot delete it from their inboxes.

# Was my post sent?

Probably, unless you got a rejection notice. When in doubt, check the list archive. Some programs (like gmail) will not display the received version of a mail you sent, because they mark it as a duplicate.

# Rooms

If you're a house looking for people:
* the **subject line must include the full cost** of the room (rent, utilities, and any other mandatory costs), or a range for multiple rooms, like "$3-500 + $50 utilities"
* you must **tell us if your house is mostly white** or all white, so BIPOC applicants have the option of avoiding these houses
* you must **not have age requirements**, and if you list your own ages you must **say you're open to all ages** (and mean it), except maybe if you really need to exclude <18
* you must say **how wheelchair accessible** the house and room are
* the house must be communal, community-oriented, intentional or cooperative in some way, ie you want the person and not just their money
* you should tell us the move-in dates (and move-out, if subletting)
* you should tell us what pets you have (for allergies) and what pets you can allow
* you should include all this info in your actual email, not just link to an external/craigslist post

If you're a person looking for a house, we are way more chill about these things, because that's hard enough already.

# Events

When you post a workshop or event, please tell us:
* what covid safety requirements you will enforce
* whether and how disabled people - eg blind or deaf or wheelchair users - can access it

For events that cost money, see [the money section](#money)

# Money

If you're asking for money in exchange for something, at least one of these must be true:
* you're not profiting, it only covers cost and expenses. we presume this is true for housing posts from non-landlords, or people selling things they previously bought
* ***OR*** you offer alternatives such as work trade, [notaflof](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/NOTAFLOF), suggested donation, [timebank hours](https://timebank.sfbace.org/), or trade/barter
* ***OR*** it's your first ad in a long time. ie you have not posted any other for-profit activity recently. we've been letting people advertise their businesses maybe once every year or two, as an experiment, but if the Chalk starts to sound like Indie Craigslist, this may change

if you're offering money in exchange for something (like a job opportunity):
* the **subject must include pay or pay range** when possible. obviously you don't always know what the market rate is, like when asking for advice or recommendations for a one-off job
* the job must pay **at least $20/hr** or equivalent (such as a fair work trade, college credit, stock options, or something else creative), with very limited exceptions (ie IHSS aides since it's not under your control)

Giving away free stuff is always cool. Requests for free stuff may get a little more scrutiny, but it's probably ok.
